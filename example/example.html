<h1>CSS Variables</h1>

<p>This is an example page to demonstrate how CSS variables work. If you
view the source for this page, you can see that a stylsheet is included as normal, 
as below:
</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./example.css"&gt;</pre>

<p>You can view this stylsheet <a href="./example.css">here</a>. Notice that
it looks identical to any other. However, it was written using CSS variables.
CSEx takes CSS that uses variables, and creates CSS 2.1 compliant stylsheets 
that can be handled as normal. You can view the original CSS source 
<a href="./example.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>The aim of CSS variables is not to introduce logic to CSS. CSS is used to style
documents, and I believe it should stay true to that purpose. However, this 
*does* aim to speed up development time when working with CSS, as well as making
changes to styles easy. It also includes functions for common tasks such as 
rounding corners, and replacing headers with images.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Variables are scoped to one stylsheet each. @import will not override
    variables, neither will link</li>
</ul>
